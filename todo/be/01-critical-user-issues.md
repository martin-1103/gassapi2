# 🚨 Phase 1: Critical User System Issues (Parallel Execution)

## Priority: 🔴 CRITICAL - Blocking All User Tests
## Estimated Time: 2-3 hours

### Issue Summary:
User tests failing because "User account is disabled" and invalid user ID format handling.

## Tasks (Can be executed in parallel):

### Task 1.1: Fix User Account Disabled Issue ⚡
**File:** `backend/src/services/AuthService.php`
**Problem:** User accounts automatically disabled after creation
**Impact:** UserTest, UserProfileTest, UserManagementTest failing
**Root Cause:** Auto-disable logic in user creation/update
**Solution:**
- [ ] Remove auto-disable logic for regular users
- [ ] Ensure test users are active by default
- [ ] Fix user status validation logic

### Task 1.2: Fix User ID Format Validation ⚡
**File:** `backend/src/handlers/UserHandler.php`
**Problem:** "Input harus berupa bilangan bulat" error for string user IDs
**Impact:** Delete user, update user operations failing
**Root Cause:** Type validation expecting integer for string user IDs
**Solution:**
- [ ] Update user ID validation to accept both string and integer
- [ ] Fix ID parsing logic in user operations
- [ ] Ensure backward compatibility with existing ID formats

### Task 1.3: Fix JSON Format Issues ⚡
**File:** `backend/src/helpers/ValidationHelper.php`
**Problem:** "Format JSON tidak valid" error in delete operations
**Impact:** User deletion failing
**Root Cause:** JSON parsing issues in request body
**Solution:**
- [ ] Fix JSON validation logic
- [ ] Handle empty request body properly
- [ ] Add proper error handling for malformed JSON

## Dependencies:
- ⬇️ None - These are foundational issues blocking other tests
- ⬆️ All other phases depend on this phase

## Success Criteria:
- [ ] UserTest passes >90% (currently 76%)
- [ ] UserProfileTest passes >90% (currently 69%)
- [ ] UserManagementTest passes >90% (currently 64%)
- [ ] No more "User account is disabled" errors
- [ ] User operations work with both string and integer IDs

## Testing:
```bash
php backend/tests/run_tests.php UserTest
php backend/tests/run_tests.php UserProfileTest
php backend/tests/run_tests.php UserManagementTest
