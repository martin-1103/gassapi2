# 🏗️ Phase 4: Project & Environment Endpoints (Parallel Execution)

## Priority: 🟢 RECOMMENDED - Missing Routes & Authorization
## Estimated Time: 2-3 hours

### Issue Summary:
Project and Environment tests failing due to missing routes and authorization issues.

## Tasks (Can be executed in parallel):

### Task 4.1: Fix Project Authorization ⚡
**Files:**
- `backend/src/handlers/ProjectHandler.php`
- `backend/src/middleware/AuthMiddleware.php`

**Problem:** Project endpoints returning 401 Unauthorized unexpectedly
**Impact:** ProjectTest failing
**Issues:**
- Create project: 401 instead of 201
- List projects: 401 instead of 200
- Auth middleware too restrictive for project operations

**Solution:**
- [ ] Review project authorization requirements
- [ ] Fix auth middleware for project endpoints
- [ ] Ensure proper token validation for project operations
- [ ] Update project endpoint permissions

### Task 4.2: Add Missing Environment Routes ⚡
**Files:**
- `backend/src/routes/EnvironmentRoutes.php` (create if missing)
- `backend/src/handlers/EnvironmentHandler.php` (create if missing)
- `backend/index.php` (route registration)

**Problem:** Environment endpoints returning 404 Route not found
**Impact:** EnvironmentTest failing badly (50% pass rate)
**Missing Routes:**
- `environment_create` - 404 instead of 401/200
- Other environment operations

**Solution:**
- [ ] Create EnvironmentHandler class
- [ ] Add environment routes to index.php
- [ ] Implement basic environment CRUD operations
- [ ] Add proper authentication for environment endpoints

### Task 4.3: Fix Environment Authorization ⚡
**Files:**
- `backend/src/handlers/EnvironmentHandler.php`
- `backend/src/middleware/AuthMiddleware.php`

**Problem:** Environment endpoints have authorization issues
**Impact:** EnvironmentTest failing
**Issues:**
- Create environment without auth returns 404 instead of 401
- Missing proper auth checks for environment operations

**Solution:**
- [ ] Add authentication to environment endpoints
- [ ] Fix authorization logic for environment operations
- [ ] Ensure proper error responses for unauthorized access
- [ ] Test environment CRUD with authentication

### Task 4.4: Add Missing MCP & Flow Routes ⚡
**Files:**
- `backend/src/routes/MCPRoutes.php` (create if missing)
- `backend/src/routes/FlowRoutes.php` (create if missing)
- `backend/src/handlers/MCPHandler.php` (create if missing)
- `backend/src/handlers/FlowHandler.php` (create if missing)

**Problem:** MCP and Flow endpoints mentioned in tests but not implemented
**Impact:** MCPRestTest, FlowTest failing
**Solution:**
- [ ] Create MCP handler and basic routes
- [ ] Create Flow handler and basic routes
- [ ] Add routes to index.php
- [ ] Implement basic CRUD operations
- [ ] Add authentication and validation

## Dependencies:
- ⬇️ Can run in parallel with all previous phases
- ⬆️ Depends on Phase 1 (user auth) working properly

## Success Criteria:
- [ ] ProjectTest passes >95% (currently 83%)
- [ ] EnvironmentTest passes >90% (currently 50%)
- [ ] MCPRestTest passes >90% (currently 75%)
- [ ] FlowTest passes >90% (currently 89%)
- [ ] All project and environment routes are accessible
- [ ] Authorization works correctly for all endpoints

## Testing:
```bash
php backend/tests/run_tests.php ProjectTest
php backend/tests/run_tests.php EnvironmentTest
php backend/tests/run_tests.php MCPRestTest
php backend/tests/run_tests.php FlowTest
```

## Expected Impact:
- ProjectTest: 10/12 → 11/12 passed (+1)
- EnvironmentTest: 6/12 → 11/12 passed (+5)
- MCPRestTest: 6/8 → 7/8 passed (+1)
- FlowTest: 8/9 → 9/9 passed (+1)

## Implementation Notes:
- [ ] Focus on basic CRUD implementation first
- [ ] Add comprehensive validation later
- [ ] Ensure consistent response format with other endpoints
- [ ] Add proper error handling and logging
