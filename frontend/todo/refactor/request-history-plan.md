# Refactoring Plan: src/lib/history/request-history.ts

## Current State
- File Size: 448 lines
- Purpose: History management with storage, search, and filtering functionality

## Issues Identified
- Multiple concerns in one file: storage, search, filtering
- Complex state persistence logic
- Difficult to maintain and test

## Refactoring Strategy

### 1. Split into Multiple Files
- Create: `src/lib/history/history-storage.ts`
  - Handle storage operations (CRUD, persistence, etc.)
- Create: `src/lib/history/history-search.ts`
  - Handle search functionality and filtering
- Create: `src/lib/history/history-filters.ts`
  - Handle different types of filters and their logic

### 2. Create History Manager Class
- Create: `HistoryManager` class to encapsulate functionality
- Provide clean API to interact with history
- Consolidate functionality while maintaining separation

### 3. Extract Utility Functions
- Create: `src/lib/history/history-utils.ts`
- Move utility functions for date formatting, data transformation, etc.

## Implementation Steps
1. Create new files for different concerns
2. Move functionality incrementally while ensuring functionality remains
3. Update imports in any files that use request-history.ts
4. Create HistoryManager class to provide unified interface
5. Test each step to ensure no functionality is broken
6. Update any calling code to use new structure

## Success Criteria
- Original file reduced to <300 lines or removed entirely
- All history functionality preserved
- Better separation of concerns
- Improved testability of individual components
