# Refactoring Plan: src/components/workspace/response-viewer/ResponseCookiesTab.tsx

## Current State
- File Size: 419 lines
- Purpose: Cookie management and display with security information

## Issues Identified
- Complex UI for cookie management
- Mixed concerns of UI and security logic
- Cookie editing functionality mixed with display

## Refactoring Strategy

### 1. Extract UI Components
- Create: `CookieTable` component
- Create: `CookieEditor` component
- Create: `CookieSecurityInfo` component
- Create: `CookieFilterPanel` component

### 2. Create Custom Hook
- Create: `useCookieManagementState` hook
- Move all state management and business logic here
- Include functions for: cookie filtering, editing, security checks, etc.

### 3. Extract Security Logic
- Create: `src/lib/security/cookie-security.ts`
- Move all security-related functions here
- Include functions for: security validation, warning generation, etc.

### 4. Extract Cookie Utilities
- Create: `src/lib/utils/cookie-utils.ts`
- Move all cookie-related utility functions here
- Include functions for: parsing, formatting, validation, etc.

## Implementation Steps
1. Create new files for extracted UI components
2. Create custom hook for state management
3. Extract security logic to separate file
4. Extract cookie utilities
5. Update imports in the main ResponseCookiesTab.tsx file
6. Test each step to ensure no functionality is broken
7. Verify UI behavior remains consistent

## Success Criteria
- Original file reduced to <300 lines
- All cookie management functionality preserved
- Better separation of concerns
- Improved maintainability of UI and business logic
