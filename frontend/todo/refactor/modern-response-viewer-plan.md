# Refactoring Plan: src/components/workspace/response-viewer/ModernResponseViewer.tsx

## Current State
- File Size: 412 lines
- Purpose: Comprehensive response viewer with multiple tabs and metadata display

## Issues Identified
- Complex component managing multiple tabs
- Mixed concerns of UI and response processing
- Metadata display mixed with tab management

## Refactoring Strategy

### 1. Extract Tab Components
- Create: `StatusTab` component
- Create: `HeadersTab` component
- Create: `BodyTab` component
- Create: `CookiesTab` component
- Create: `TimelineTab` component
- Create: `MetadataTab` component

### 2. Create Custom Hook
- Create: `useResponseViewState` hook
- Move all state management and business logic here
- Include functions for: tab switching, response processing, etc.

### 3. Extract Metadata Display
- Create: `ResponseMetadata` component
- Move all metadata display functionality here
- Include status information, timing, etc.

### 4. Extract Response Processing Utilities
- Create: `src/lib/response/response-processor.ts`
- Move all response processing functions here
- Include functions for: response analysis, formatting, etc.

## Implementation Steps
1. Create new files for tab components
2. Create custom hook for state management
3. Extract metadata display to separate component
4. Extract response processing utilities
5. Update imports in the main ModernResponseViewer.tsx file
6. Test each step to ensure no functionality is broken
7. Verify UI behavior remains consistent

## Success Criteria
- Original file reduced to <300 lines
- All response viewer functionality preserved
- Better separation of concerns
- Improved maintainability of UI and business logic
