# Refactoring Plan: src/components/workspace/response-tabs/tests-tab.tsx

## Current State
- File Size: 492 lines
- Purpose: Tab for displaying and managing test results with complex state management

## Issues Identified
- Complex UI with multiple sections
- Complex state management for test execution and results
- Mixed concerns of UI and business logic

## Refactoring Strategy

### 1. Extract UI Components
- Create: `TestResultViewer` component
- Create: `AssertionList` component
- Create: `TestExecutionControls` component
- Create: `TestSummaryPanel` component

### 2. Create Custom Hook
- Create: `useTestResultsState` hook
- Move all state management and business logic here
- Include functions for: test execution, result processing, filtering, etc.

### 3. Extract Test Execution Logic
- Create: `src/lib/testing/test-execution.ts`
- Move all test execution functions here
- Include functions for: running tests, processing results, etc.

### 4. Extract Test Result Processing
- Create: `src/lib/testing/test-results-processor.ts`
- Move all result processing logic here
- Include functions for: result formatting, aggregation, etc.

## Implementation Steps
1. Create new files for extracted UI components
2. Create custom hook for state management
3. Extract test execution logic to separate file
4. Extract test result processing logic
5. Update imports in the main tests-tab.tsx file
6. Test each step to ensure no functionality is broken
7. Verify UI behavior remains consistent

## Success Criteria
- Original file reduced to <300 lines
- All test result functionality preserved
- Better separation of concerns
- Improved maintainability of UI and business logic
