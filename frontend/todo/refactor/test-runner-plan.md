# Refactoring Plan: src/lib/testing/test-runner.ts

## Current State
- File Size: 526 lines
- Purpose: Engine for executing API tests with complex logic

## Issues Identified
- Mixed concerns: test execution, validation, assertion logic
- Large monolithic file with complex dependencies
- Difficult to maintain and extend

## Refactoring Strategy

### 1. Extract Assertion Logic
- Create: `src/lib/testing/assertion-engine.ts`
- Move all assertion functions and utilities here
- Include different types of assertions (JSON, headers, status codes, etc.)

### 2. Extract Validation Logic
- Create: `src/lib/testing/validation-engine.ts`
- Move response validation functions here
- Include schema validation, content validation, etc.

### 3. Extract Response Handling
- Create: `src/lib/testing/response-handler.ts`
- Move all response processing logic here
- Include response parsing, formatting, etc.

### 4. Restructure as Class
- Create: `TestRunnerEngine` class with smaller methods
- Separate concerns between test execution, result reporting, and configuration

## Implementation Steps
1. Create new files for extracted functionality
2. Move logic incrementally while ensuring functionality remains
3. Update imports in the main test-runner.ts file
4. Test each step to ensure no functionality is broken
5. Verify test execution behavior remains consistent

## Success Criteria
- Original file reduced to <300 lines
- All test execution functionality preserved
- Better separation of concerns
- Improved maintainability and extensibility
