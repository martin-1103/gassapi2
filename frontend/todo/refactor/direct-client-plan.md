# Refactoring Plan: src/lib/api/direct-client.ts

## Current State
- File Size: 306 lines
- Purpose: Direct API client implementation with HTTP request handling

## Issues Identified
- Mixed concerns: request handling, error management, retry logic
- All client functionality in one file
- Difficult to maintain and extend

## Refactoring Strategy

### 1. Split by Concern
- Create: `src/lib/api/request-handler.ts`
  - Handle request preparation and sending
- Create: `src/lib/api/response-handler.ts`
  - Handle response processing
- Create: `src/lib/api/error-handler.ts`
  - Handle error management and retry logic

### 2. Create API Client Class
- Create: `ApiClient` class with smaller, focused methods
- Separate concerns between different aspects of API communication

### 3. Extract Utilities
- Create: `src/lib/api/api-utils.ts`
- Move utility functions for API operations

## Implementation Steps
1. Create new files for different concerns
2. Move functionality incrementally while ensuring functionality remains
3. Create ApiClient class with focused methods
4. Update imports in any files that use direct-client.ts
5. Test each step to ensure no functionality is broken
6. Update any calling code to use new structure

## Success Criteria
- Original file reduced to <300 lines or removed entirely
- All API client functionality preserved
- Better separation of concerns
- Improved maintainability and extensibility
