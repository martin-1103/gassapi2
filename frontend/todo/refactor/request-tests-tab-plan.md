# Refactoring Plan: src/components/workspace/request-tabs/tests-tab.tsx

## Current State
- File Size: 432 lines
- Purpose: Test configuration interface with assertion builder and test script editor

## Issues Identified
- Complex UI with multiple sections for test configuration
- Mixed concerns of UI and test logic
- Test result visualization mixed with configuration

## Refactoring Strategy

### 1. Extract UI Components
- Create: `AssertionBuilder` component
- Create: `TestScriptEditor` component
- Create: `TestResultViewer` component
- Create: `TestConfigForm` component
- Create: `AssertionList` component

### 2. Create Custom Hook
- Create: `useTestConfigurationState` hook
- Move all state management and business logic here
- Include functions for: test configuration, validation, etc.

### 3. Extract Assertion Logic
- Create: `src/lib/testing/test-assertions.ts`
- Move all assertion building functions here
- Include functions for: assertion creation, validation, etc.

### 4. Extract Test Utilities
- Create: `src/lib/testing/test-utils.ts`
- Move all test-related utility functions here
- Include functions for: test configuration, script validation, etc.

## Implementation Steps
1. Create new files for extracted UI components
2. Create custom hook for state management
3. Extract assertion logic to separate file
4. Extract test utilities
5. Update imports in the main tests-tab.tsx file
6. Test each step to ensure no functionality is broken
7. Verify UI behavior remains consistent

## Success Criteria
- Original file reduced to <300 lines
- All test configuration functionality preserved
- Better separation of concerns
- Improved maintainability of UI and business logic
